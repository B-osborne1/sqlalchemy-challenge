# sqlalchemy-challenge
This repo focuses on the use of SQLAlchemy and Flask to create an analysis and API of the weather and precipitation values from weather stations in Hawaii.

It consists of three key sections:

1) Resources folder: Data procured for Hawaii's weather, supplemented by an SQLite file
2) climate_starter_adjusted is a python script that uses SQLAlchemy to collect data and graph both rainfall and precipitation. 
3) app_solution is a python file that is set up to be used with flask. This is typically an interactable reflection of the data pulled from climate_starter_adjusted.

It is noted that at this stage, the app_solution flask file is not yet completed.
